#A D&D-based guide to Growth & Contribution in the Django Community

##Brief Description
If you think, "*I'm not a great coder or web dev, so I can't contribute to Django. :-(*", you're WRONG!  Using classes and roles from Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) as a lens, we'll look at multiple roles in the Django community, and how to find one for you. We'll see how beginners can progress & how to encourage outsiders to join & contribute. A brief, relevant D&D primer will be provided.

##Detailed Abstract
###Main Idea
>"Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure." - [D&D 5E free downloadable rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules)
