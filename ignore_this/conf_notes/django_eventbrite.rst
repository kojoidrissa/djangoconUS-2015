How I learned Django while working at Eventbrite
========

Why You should learn at work
----
* There's support and some sort of framework in place for you
* You're doing something useful
* You CAN'T give up! Your company NEEDS you!
  
How to learn
-----
* One thing at a time...and always something.
* Managers & Old Timers: tell people what they should be learning. HELP them develop.
* Different learning styles: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic
  
Working with Others
----
* find someone w/ a style similar to yours
* schedule time w/ them
* Show them what you've figured out on your own
* Find ways to help THEM while you learn.
  
What to work on?
----
* What's important to your company?
* What're people complaining about?
  
Time Management
----
* Timebox your efforts
* Prioritize/create a squence
* Leave comments in the code when you take a break (what do you need to do when you pick things back up?)
  
Write Things Down!
----
* What you've learned
  
  * Reference
  * starts docs for other co-workers
  * lets you track accomplishments, for you and your managers
    
* What you WANT to learn
  
  * keeps you from going on tangents
  * lets you follow up later
  * reminds you of the prior times when you wanted to learn something
    
Teach
----
*  New learners are usually the best teachers, as they've gone through the process recently
