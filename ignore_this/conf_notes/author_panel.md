#[DJANGO AUTHORS PANEL](http://2015.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/56/)

Mark Lavin, Andrew Pinkham, Buddy Lindsey, Peter Baumgartner, Rikki Endsley, Tracy Osborn

##Who do you write for? NorAm or Int'l audience?
-  Tracy: Self-publisher, she has to consider all of those. Publishes on 3 different platforms. Int'l is an issue
-  Peter: Hasn't focused on Int'l audiences
-  Mark: Intrmdt-Advanced; not focused on Int'l audience; wrote it for the HATERS who didn't want to use Django.
-  Andrew: Pearson (his publisher) handles int'l IF they think there's a market.
-  Buddy: question tweaked for him, since he publishes videos.
    -  His audience: 20-40 yr olds; 80% male, 20% female
    -  He's added captioning for hearing-impaired audiences. It also makes future translations easier

##What tools do you use for creating your content?
-  Peter: Used Sphinx, doesn't like it. Used LaTex for layout, likes it even LESS.
-  Tracy: writes in Markdown, publishes through LeanPub. LeanPub creates PDF/epub/mobi. MacVim is editor.
-  Mark: Publisher (ORA) worried about formats. "It was magic." Wrote in ASCII doc.
-  Andrew: Took the software dev approach. Markdown->Pandoc Markdown->LaTex
-  Buddy: I Show You HD for screens; Audacity for audio;

##What's your process for creating content? Do you have an outline first?
-  Mark: had a co-author(Julia Elman); they'd take chapters. He'd write LOTS of bad stuff, Julia would refine it.
-  Andrew: Source material came from a class he was teaching
-  Peter: book started as a wrap-up letter for a client engagement.
-  Buddy: Takes "long-term blogging approach". Ideas: what do I want to learn? What are people asking me/complaining about online?
-  Tracy: Book 1 - What's an MVP project people would want to build, then worked backwards from there.  Book 2 - Each chapter is stand-alone?

##How do you choose your license?
-  Andrew: Thought he had no say in the matter. Turned out, he did. If he'd picked, he would've looked at the Creative Commons licenses. He'd like to be able to give it away, since he wrote it FOR the community. But he'd also like to eat.
-  Buddy: For now, creates full copyright. Some is free, some is not.
-  Tracy: Retains copyright. Feels awkward sometimes charging for beginner content. 
-  Peter: Retains copyright. Making a book is hard, he probably wouldn't do it again.
-  Mark: Spoke to Harry Percival (Testing Goat from ORA) about making his content free. The SUBJECT MATTER is open source, the BOOK is **not** Open Source (the community isn't contributing to the book).

##Audience questions
###How'd you maintain your sense of wellness while writing?
-  Mark: He and Julia supported each other. Didn't really find a balance.
-  Tracy: switches b/w startup and book
-  Buddy: has strict deadlines
    +  6am-4pm: Day job
    +  4-6: Family time
    +  6-9: GoDjango

###How do you focus on JUST your specific area, when there's so much info you COULD cover? (Eric from ReadTheDocs)
-  Andrew: made sure all his code was heavily annotated
-  Mark: Know your audience, focus on that you're trying to deliver to THEM.

###(@Jacobian)How do they compare themselves to the Django docs that exist?
-  Peter: Docs are opinionated. His book focuses on best practices.
-  Tracy: tried using Polls. Didn't work, she used Kenneth Love's videos.

###Couldn't hear the whole question. Paper vs ebooks? What editors?
-  Mark: Likes print editions, force him to type code
-  Buddy: doesn't have full examples to prevent copy/paste.

###Are books being surpassed by video or online learning?
-  Tracy: Books get outdated fast
-  Andrew: Codeacademy & other sites often lock you into their "learning sandbox".
