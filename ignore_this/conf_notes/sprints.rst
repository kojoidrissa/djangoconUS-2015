Fixing a typo on https://code.djangoproject.com/

Under 'Getting Involved', you're told: "To log a ticket, or add content to this wiki, log in with a GitHub account.". Once you've logged in w/ a GitHub account, there's no guideance on HOW to edit the wiki or where those files are stored.

Nevermind.
