#Inlcusion Proposal DRAFT
The Django community has a variety of needs to continue to grow and thrive. Most of these needs will be filled by volunteers in the community. Different needs require different skills & personalities among community members. An inclusive community culture maximizes the odds of having the different skills & personalities we need.

We'll start with "why", focusing on the functional benefits of being Inclusive. We'll then spend most of our time on the "how": what steps can each of us take to help foster a more inclusive culture around us?

We'll also look at how *Inclusiveness* is NOT the same thing as *Diversity* or *Political Correctness*.
