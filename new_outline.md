#New Outline 2015-09-01

#Motivation
-  New-ish active coder; how can I contribute?
-  Help grow the community! Not just any growth, AWESOME growth
    +  Contributors over Bodies

##The issue: A small pool to draw from
-  Tech communities are still predominantly made up of white cis gendered heterosexual men. Thus, those communities are often unaware of how much they cater to **that** specific demographic while potentially alienating others.
-  That alienation
    +  often goes unnoticed by the group doing it (it's usually unintentional)
    +  reduces the pool of likely potential contributors to <= [30.8% of the (US) population](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html), before adjusting for LGBTQ people and other groups.
        +  I could use help w/ global numbers.
        +  Do I want a Pie Chart here?
-  Further reduce that pool by
    +  People who don't want to join or contribute to our community because it's "too hard", "too nerdy", "too rigorous" etc.
    +  People who would, but have joined another community (Rails, Drupal, Wordpress, etc)
+  Making the pool bigger

##Inclusion > Diversity
-  Inviting new people is easy. Making them feel welcome enough to stay is the key.
-  But how?

#Practicing Inclusivity 101: Building Awareness
-  Check your assumptions
-  Zen of Python on Inclusion Awareness
    +  `Errors should never pass silently`
        +  Check for 'exceptions'(Is there anyone who seems left out? Uncomfortable? "Boxed in" by another participant?)
    +  `In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess`
        *  I'm bad at this one, but getting better
+  "...left as an exercise for the reader": Flip the Demographics to build empathy.
    *  flip on multiple axes: Race; ethnicity; gender; gender identity; sexual orientation; experience level

#Practicing Inclusivity 102: Taking Action
> [If you run a community, and you allow assholes to be awful to members of your community, that means you’re the asshole.](https://twitter.com/fraying/status/610644474734055424) - Derek Powazek via Twitter

-  Process your log files
    -  be prepared to share your concerns/observations with community organizers or leaders
-  Feedback mechanism? Does your community have one? And if so, is it clear and obvious that you WANT/WELCOME feedback? Even if it's negative?
    +  It should be anonymous by default
    -  "They could make a comment or message me on Meetup" is the wrong answer.
*  Having greeters/ambassadors in your community
    -  designated people to interface with new visitors
    -  *Your community has a small window of 'first contact' with new visitors* Neeraj Tandon
+  Get out of your bubble
    +  non-technical people are the LARGEST growth vector for any community
    +  If you're missing a certain skill set, you're more likely to find it OUTSIDE your current circles
    -  Anna Ravenscroft, EuroPython 2011, [Diversity as a Dependency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLYI46Ou-wI) at about 50 minutes, suggests you "bring someone who is NOT like you" to the next conference.
        +  My addenedum: ask them if they'd come to another event? Why or why not?

#Practicing Inclusivity 103: Understanding The Power of Privilege
>“Privilege isn't wealth or having it easy: it's what you don't have to deal with”  @JustSlyRed #AlterConf 
 - Tweet by [Kojo](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/592068382754635776), quoting [@JustSlyRed](https://twitter.com/JustSlyRed) at [Alterconf - Austin](http://www.alterconf.com/speakers/mario-jara)

+  Privilege Arbitrage
    *  Using relative higher privilege to benefit those with relative lower privilege in the same area/setting.
*  Develop a Personal Privilege Profile for yourself. This can help you identify areas to perform Privilege Arbitrage. The [Buzzfeed Privilege Quiz](http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/how-privileged-are-you#.rva5j0d3o5) is a decent **starting point**.

#Final Words

The more people involved, the less each has to do. And the less there is TO do.
