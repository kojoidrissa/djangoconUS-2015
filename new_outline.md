-  New-ish active coder; how can I contribute?
-  Help grow the community! Not just any growth, AWESOME growth
    +  Contributors over Bodies
-  Issues around 

I'm relatively new as an active coder (2013?), so I want to make contributions. It wasn't going to be writing code, but I knew what drew me to coding and thought I could help the community grow. So, I started looking at ways to bring people into the community. But, I wanted to focus on adding new contributors and letting new people know they COULD contribute.  This lead to:
"Lots of different ways to contribute" ==> and "Lots of different TYPES of people need to contribute"

Tech communities are still predominantly made up of white cis gendered heterosexual men.
