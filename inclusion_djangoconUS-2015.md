#WHAT?
-  **You** recognize the value of Inclusiveness. But how do you discuss it with people who don't (yet)?
    +  The 'business case' for Inclusion
    +  "I want to help, but I don't know how"
-  **Avoid**: The false dichotomy of morality
-  **Embrace**: Inclusive == Winning


#Vocabulary: Why I focus on "Inclusiveness" 
-  I am NOT a sociologist
-  **Political Correctness**: "I don't like `derogatory term for a group` but I've been told I can't call them `derogatory term`. I have to call them `PC term for a group`."
    +  a 'naive solution'
    +  often makes a bad situation worse
-  **Diversity**: Lots of different *types* of people
    +  another 'naive solution'
    +  easy to measure, easy to 'game', hard to sustain
-  **Inclusion**: Welcome all who wish to peacefully co-exist or contribute
    +  harder to implement, requires cultural change
    +  provides a superset of above two terms

#WHY?
-  To build a strong "party", you need many types of *awesome*
-  Inherent limits on each community
    +  tech is "hard", requires 'rigor'; as such, some people won't want to do it
    *  BUT, you have no idea who those *some* people are. See, "*Assumptions*".
-  "We don't need ANY more contributors or community members"
    *  No FLOSS project, ever
+  Inclusion lets you maximize the number of contributors

#HOW

#Practicing Inclusivity 101: Building Awareness
-  Check your assumptions
-  Zen of Python on Inclusiveness
    +  `Errors should never pass silently`
        +  Remain vigilant
            +  check for exceptions, validate form inputs (**101**)
        +  Discuss errors as they occur (**102**)
    +  `In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess`: how much does the ambiguity matter?
+  Get out of your bubble
    +  non-technical people are the LARGEST growth vector for any community
    +  If you're missing a certain skill set, you're more likely to find it OUTSIDE your current circles
    -  Anna Ravenscroft, EuroPython 2011, [Diversity as a Dependency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLYI46Ou-wI) at about 50 minutes, suggests you "bring someone who is NOT like you" to the next conference.
+  Flip the Demographics

#Practicing Inclusivity 102: Taking Action
> [If you run a community, and you allow assholes to be awful to members of your community, that means you’re the asshole.](https://twitter.com/fraying/status/610644474734055424) - Derek Powazek via Twitter


-  Sharing your concerns/observations with community organizers or leaders
-  Feedback mechanism? Do you have one? And if so, is it clear and obvious that you WANT/WELCOME feedback? Even if it's negative?
    +  It should be anonymous by default
    -  "They could make a comment on Meetup" is the wrong answer.

#Practicing Inclusivity 103: Understanding The Power of Privilege
>“Privilege isn't wealth or having it easy: it's what you don't have to deal with”  @JustSlyRed #AlterConf 
 - Tweet by [Kojo](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/592068382754635776), quoting [@JustSlyRed](https://twitter.com/JustSlyRed) at [Alterconf - Austin](http://www.alterconf.com/speakers/mario-jara)

+  Privilege Arbitrage
    *  Using relative higher privilege to benefit those with relative lower privilege in the same area/setting.
*  Your Personal Privilege Matrix (WHAT TO USE AS AXES?)
    -  CIS  Gendered
        +  non = 5; people have NO IDEA;
    -  Heterosexual vs. Other
        +  Homo > Bi > Pan/Poly
        +  The more "understood", the more privileged
    -  Male
        +  A generally decreased physical risk threshold
    -  White
    -  Educational background
        +  What options do you have?
        +  What options are you AWARE of?
    -  Wealth
        *  $50K/year passive income > $100K/year active income
        *  multi-generational? Opportunities?
        *  Compare to national averages (to make more objective)
    -  Income
        +  Minimum wage($15K/year) vs. $50K/year vs $100K+/year
        +  Compare to national averages (to make more objective)
        +  [Legislators and corporate lobbyists meet in secret at Georgia resort](http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/investigations/2015/05/21/investigators-legislators-and-corporate-lobbyists-meet-in-secret-at-georgia-resort/27695105/): An apparently CIS gendered heterosexual white professional male **with a television news crew** ran OUT of privilege when money was involved.

<!-- #Do's & Don'ts

##Do: Be empathetic

##Do: Continue learning on your own

##Don't: Focus primarily on "legal compliance"

##Don't: Be afraid to be "wrong"
 -->

#What if you can't?
If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. An insincere effort often does more harm than good. 

Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

#Final Words

>[Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort.](https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/514104755660914688) - Jacob Kaplan-Moss/@jacobian, Django core contributer and former BDFL

...
>[By as many community members as possible.](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/600510473516163073) - Kojo Idrissa/@transition

The more people involved, the less each has to do. And the less there is TO do. It's a process/journey, not a product/destination.


#I'm not so smart

#I'm not so great
On 2015-08-18 (3 weeks - 1 day ago) I was at MY local Python meetup. When I got home & checked Twitter (21:33:32), [THIS tweet from the DjangoCon US chair](https://twitter.com/webology/status/633822723437805568) was in my time line. Reading it made me think: had I then been practicing ANY of what I JUST preached (and had ALREADY written over a month ago), 45 minutes ago? No, because I was too caught up in my own conversations.

THIS is why we need 'as many community members as possible' placing some of their focus on this.
