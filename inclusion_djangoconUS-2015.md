#WHAT?
-  **You** recognize the value of Inclusiveness. But how do you discuss it with people who don't (yet)?
    +  The 'business case' for Inclusion
    +  "I want to help, but I don't know how"
-  **Avoid**: The false dichotomy of morality
-  **Embrace**: Inclusive == Winning


#Vocabulary: Why I focus on "Inclusiveness" 
-  I am NOT a sociologist
-  **Political Correctness**: "I don't like `derogatory term for a group` but I've been told I can't call them `derogatory term`. I have to call them `PC term for a group`."
    +  a 'naive solution'
    +  often makes a bad situation worse
-  **Diversity**: Lots of different *types* of people
    +  another 'naive solution'
    +  easy to measure, easy to 'game', hard to sustain
-  **Inclusion**: Welcome all who wish to peacefully co-exist or contribute
    +  harder to implement, requires cultural change
    +  provides a superset of above two terms

#WHY?
-  To build a strong "party", you need many types of *awesome*
-  Inherent limits on each community
    +  tech is "hard", requires 'rigor'; as such, some people won't want to do it
    *  BUT, you have no idea who those *some* people are. See, "*Assumptions*".
-  "We don't need ANY more contributors or community members"
    *  No FLOSS project, ever
+  Inclusion lets you maximize the number of contributors

#HOW: Practicing Inclusivity 101
-  Check your assumptions
-  Zen of Python on Inclusiveness
    +  `Errors should never pass silently`
        +  Remain vigilant, check for exceptions, validate form inputs
        +  Discuss errors when they occur (102)
    +  `In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess`: how much does the ambiguity matter?
+  Get out of your bubble
    +  non-technical people are the LARGEST growth vector for any community
    +  If you're missing a certain skill set, you're more likely to find it OUTSIDE your current circles
    -  Anna Ravenscroft, EuroPython 2011, [Diversity as a Dependency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLYI46Ou-wI) at about 50 minutes, suggests you "bring someone who is NOT like you" to the next conference.
+  Flip the Demographics

#Practicing Inclusivity 102: Understanding The Power of Privilege
*  Your Personal Privilege Matrix
+  Privilege Arbitrage
+  "Turn Your Sadness Into Kindness"

<!-- #Do's & Don'ts

##Do: Be empathetic

##Do: Continue learning on your own

##Don't: Focus primarily on "legal compliance"

##Don't: Be afraid to be "wrong"
 -->

#What if you can't?
If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. An insincere effort often does more harm than good. 

Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

#Final Words

>[Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort.](https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/514104755660914688) - Jacob Kaplan-Moss/@jacobian, Django core contributer and former BDFL

The more people involved, the less each has to do. And the less there is TO do. It's a process/journey, not a product/destination.
