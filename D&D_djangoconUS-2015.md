#Main
"Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure."
    [D&D 5E free downloadable rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules)

#Quick D&D Class Primer
-  Based on "Lord of the Rings"
-  Classes
    -  Fighter
    -  Wizard (Magic-User)
    -  Rogue (Thief)
    -  Cleric
-  From 4e: Roles
    -  Defender
    -  Controller
    -  Striker
    -  Leader

#Classes and Roles in action: I DESCRIBE a mini adventure!!
+  A dragon controlling an army of goblins
+  Wizard: Chain Lightning; Sleep; Fireball; Ice Storm
+  Fighter: heads towards the dragon, drawing attenion from goblins
+  Rogue: sneaks past the goblins, behind the dragon
+  Cleric: Bolsters allies; hinders foes; heals as needed
+  Rogue sneak attack; Fighter great cleave; Wizard Lightning Bolt; Cleric Divine strike
    *  Differing damage types overcome resistance
+  Loot!! Glory!!

#Roles
##How to become a Python Wizard Superstar
*  Code (basic scripts; procedural)
*  More code (functions; modular code)
*  MOAR CODE (data structures & algorithms)
    -  [Computer science fundamentals for self-taught programmers](http://pyvideo.org/video/2588/computer-science-fundamentals-for-self-taught-pro)
*  Wicked Code (OO code; OOA&D)
*  Read other people's code
*  I had to find a way to include "[Castle Anthrax: Dungeon Generation Techniques](http://pyvideo.org/video/2582/castle-anthrax-dungeon-generation-techniques)"
*  1337 codez!! ((learn a new paradigm; Functional programming?)???)

#How to become a Python Luminary
+  Like Clerics or "Leader" roles? Mostly speaking TO the community
-  Code
-  Present locally
    +  PyHouston; Py Web Houston; PyLadiesHTX; PyLadiesATX
-  Present regionally
    +  PyTexas; PyArkansas; PyOhio
-  Present nationally
-  Present globally
-  Profit!!

#How to be a Python Evangelist
+  Like Bards? Mostly speaking OUTSIDE the community, but **for/on behalf** of the community
+  Focus on how to use Python to solve problems in YOUR domain
+  Learn to speak in terms your target audience will understand, not just other programmers.

#How to be a Python Educator
-  Similar to Evangelist or Luminary, with more emphasis on increasing the skills of others or introducing them to new options

#How to Contribute to Python w/ minimal coding skills
-  Docs
-  Translation
-  Evangilize
*  Not an EXHAUSTIVE LIST, just a beginning
    -  Multi-class!!

#Building a strong "party"
-  Once you establish different roles are required, it's logical that different types of people may be needed to fill those roles. Or, that different types of people may prefer different types of roles.
-  Diversity vs. Inclusion vs. Political Correctness
    +  Diversity: Lots of different *types* of people
    +  Political correctness: I hate `derogatory term for a group of people` but I've been told I can't call them `derogatory term`. I'm supposed to call them `PC term for a group of people`
    +  Inclusion: Welcoming to all who wish to peacefully co-exist
    +  Python doesn't need more "X" people. Python needs more people who can and will support Python. Those people exist in varied forms.
    +  For more academic discussion on Diversity vs. Inclusion: http://www.armydiversity.army.mil/document/Disentangling.pdf
-  Inherent Limits on the community
    +  programming is "hard", requires 'rigor'; as such, some people won't want to do it
    +  more people think, "I wish I could program/It would be cool to program" than "I'm going to spend the time and effort required to learn to create software that solves a problem"

#Zen of Python
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
**Explicit is better than implicit.**
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
*Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.*
*Although practicality beats purity.*
**Errors should never pass silently.**
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
**Now is better than never.**
*Although never is often better than *right* now.*
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

#How to be inclusive?
-  Check your assumptions
    +  "You made an assumption you didn't realize you'd made."
+  'import this' on Inclusiveness
    -  Errors pass silently (which Zen of Python does NOT like)
        +  Errors should never pass silently.
    -  Although practicality beats purity.
    -  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    -  Now is better than never.
        +  Although never is often better than *right* now.
-  Learn to interact with people outside your immediate sphere
    +  don't just talk to other coders
        +  non-programmers are the LARGEST growth vector for Python
        +  Python's clean, readable, understandable syntax makes it inviting to "non-programmers"
    -  Anna Ravenscroft, at about 50 minutes, suggests you "bring someone who is NOT like you" to the next EuroPython (or Python conference).
-  Ignore legal requirements
    +  no one wants to feel "forced"
-  Consider the feelings of others
-  Practice inclusivity in your local Python community
-  Have a wider range of people at your local Python events

#What if you can't?
If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

#Final Words
[Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort.](https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/514104755660914688)

That goes for people too, especially **me**. It's a process/journey, not a product/destination.
